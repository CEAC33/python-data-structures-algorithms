## Company and Job Types

### Company Types Overview

**Company Types**
- Big "4"
- Medium Size Companies
- Startups
  - 1-15 Employees
  - Well-Funded "Startups"
  
**Big "4"**
- Several Companies
  - Microsoft
  - Facebook
  - Amazon
  - Apple
  - Google/Alphabet
- Culture varies greatly between all of them
- Check out Glassdoor reviews for specific information on each of them
- They recruit heavily from the top 5-10 Universities (U.S. News. Rankings)
- Management structure in place
- On boarding process
- Decisions at the company level take share-holders into account
- Huge amount of applicants

**Medium Size Companies**
- Local companies
  - May have satellite offices
- May be a stronger focus on profitability
- Management structure can possibly be more informal
  - Try to ask about this during your interview
  
**Start-ups (Small)**
- Lower Salaries but higher equity
- Keep in mind high probability of failure (~90%)
- Equity can be complicated, check out:

- You will learn a lot
- You will also work a lot
- People are key at this stage

**Well-funded Startups**
- Salaries can be comparable to Big 4
- Equity at this stage is even more complicated

- Keep in mind funding doesn't guarantee success

**Conclusion**
- Always research the companies beforehand
- Think about work/life balance and what your long term career goals are

### Job Type Overviews

**Job Types**
- Infrastructure
- Backend
- Frontend
- Native
- Science and Theory
- Marketing
- Hardware and Graphics

**Infrastructure**
- Sysadmin (managing, setting up, and keeping systems running)
- Dev-ops (creating & using tools that devs use to manage systems)
- Network Engineer (setting up, designing, and optimizing network infrastructures, TCP/IP, and other layers of the network stack)
- Data Center Ops (they keep "the cloud" running)
- Cable & Router Technicians
- Database Administrators
- Technical Support & Documentation

**Backend**
- Full stack engineers (a little bit of everything)
- Backend Application Development (rails, django, node, etc.)
- Project Management (not always a technical role)
- Engineering Management (usually former developers)
- Software Architects (planning out features before they are coded)
- API Design (designing the interfaces between systems)
- Security & Pentesting
- Distributed System Architects (dealing with consistency, availability, partition tolerance, timing, of large, globally-separated systems)
- Database Administrators (managing, maintaining, sharding, and migrating data stores, different from infrastructure-focused DBAs in that they are also writing backend code which interacts with the stores)

**Frontend**
- Full Stack (a little bit of everything, but focused primarily on the pieces that support a frontend)
- UX/UI Front end designers (photoshop, indesign, sketch, html & css, etc. only)
- General front end web development (html, css, and js)
- Single-page app development (mostly with JS frameworks, e.g. angular or react)
- Quality Assurance & Testing (writing tests, doing human tests, making sure things work)
- iOS, Android, Windows Mobile, etc.
- Consumer-facing Windows Desktop, OS X Desktop, Linux app development
- Enterprise software development (large, made-to-order applications for businesses)
- IT administration & admin software design (often very system-specific, hence the Native category)
- Software Architecture (similar to backend architecture, designing features before they are coded)

**Science and Theory**
- Scientific Research (Matlab, R, and ipython and more)
- "Pure Compsci/Pure Math" Research (with haskell, lisp, lots more)
- Scientific Software Development (e.g. protein folding software)
- Data Science (matlab, r, ipython, scikit-learn, etc.)
- Machine Learning
- OS Design (not just microsoft, windows, & linux, also qualcomm and lots of other telecoms hire tens of thousands of engineers to write embedded and mobile OSs)

**Marketing**
- Growth hacking/web scraping (selenium, beautifulsoup, phantomjs, scikit-learn, pattern, etc.)
- Analytics (GA, mixpanel, optimizely, etc. closely tied with marketing and SEO)
- SEO & SEM (techniques for search engines)
- General Marketing Development (salesforce, analytics, content-design, and SEO)

**Hardware and Graphics**
- Embedded Software (code that runs very close to the metal, e.g. the assembly code running your elevator)
- Chip Design & Architecture
- Game development
- Graphics software development
- 3D printing and machining coding
- CGI & Animation
