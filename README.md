## Company and Job Types

### Company Types Overview

**Company Types**
- Big "4"
- Medium Size Companies
- Startups
  - 1-15 Employees
  - Well-Funded "Startups"
  
**Big "4"**
- Several Companies
  - Microsoft
  - Facebook
  - Amazon
  - Apple
  - Google/Alphabet
- Culture varies greatly between all of them
- Check out Glassdoor reviews for specific information on each of them
- They recruit heavily from the top 5-10 Universities (U.S. News. Rankings)
- Management structure in place
- On boarding process
- Decisions at the company level take share-holders into account
- Huge amount of applicants

**Medium Size Companies**
- Local companies
  - May have satellite offices
- May be a stronger focus on profitability
- Management structure can possibly be more informal
  - Try to ask about this during your interview
  
**Start-ups (Small)**
- Lower Salaries but higher equity
- Keep in mind high probability of failure (~90%)
- Equity can be complicated, check out:
  - http://stockoptioncounsel.com/
- You will learn a lot
- You will also work a lot
- People are key at this stage

**Well-funded Startups**
- Salaries can be comparable to Big 4
- Equity at this stage is even more complicated
- For a good list of companies at this stage

- Keep in mind funding doesn't guarantee success

**Conclusion**
- Always research the companies beforehand
- Think about work/life balance and what your long term career goals are

- CGI & Animation

## Resume Preparation

**1) One Page Resume**
Recruiters *do not* reead your resume;they do a 15-30 second "spot check"of your resume. When your resume is too long, it just takes your best stuff - the stuff that would have made the "one page cut" - and dilutes it with more mediocre content. Lengthy resumes *do not* make you more impressive. A good rule of thumb is to keep your resume to one page if you have less than 10 years of experience or *at most* two pages if you have more than 10 years of experience.

**2) No Objectives**
All on objective does is state, in a wordy way, what position you're interested in. The company already knows that because you applied for a particular position. At best, it'll just waste space. At worst, it'll limit you since it'll exclude other positions that might have been interesting to you

**3) Use a Resume Template with Columns**
Unless you're great with design, you probably shouldn't be creating your own resume template. It'll most likely look sloppy. Use a template, and make sure it has multiple columns. Using three columns, for example, will allow you to put the company name, position, and date all on one line. This makes it easier to read and saves space

**4) Use Tables**
If you're using Microsoft Word to create your resume (which probably should), use Microsoft Word's "tables". Just make sure to hide the borders afterwards

**5) Short Bullets**
Because resume screeners only spend 15-30 seconds on your resume, length bullets - anything that feels like a paragraph - just won't get read. Keep your bullets to one to two lines (with one line being better than two)

**6) Accomplishment Oriented**
Your bullets should focus on your *accomplishments* - that is, the impact you had - rather than your responsibilities. What did you build, create, design, optimize, lead, etc?

**7) Quantify**
Whenever possible, you should quantify your accomplishments. If you optimized something, by how much? If you won an award, out of how many people?

**8) Resume**
The general rule of thumb is to list your GPA if it's at least 3.0 or higher, but there are two important rules to know here: (1) You may choose to list your in-major GPA if it's higher than your overall GPA, but you need to specify that it's your in-major GPA. (2) If your school uses a different scale (such as a 10-point scale), you want to convert your GPA to a 4.0-scale which will be more widely understood

**9) Projects**
Most candidates should pick their top 3-5 projectsto list on their resume. These can be academic required project or independent projects. They *do not* need to be completed or launched either. As long as you've done a "meaty" amount of work on them, that's good enough!

**10) Additional Experience**
You can put additional experience, like leadership activitiees or awards, in a section like this (changing the name of the section depending on what you list).
Be careful here to focus on what really matters.
If you're applying for a coding role, your role as an eagle scout in high school is probably not very important!

**11) Languages and Technologies**
It's a good idea to list your languages and technologies, but remember that anything you list here is "fair game" for the interviewer to test.
If you want to list a language but you happen to be a bit rusty in it, consider listing it as something like: "C++ (Proeficient), C# (Prior Experience), ..."

**12) What did you NOT include?**
Is there anything impressive / interesting that you've done that you left out?
About 50% of candidates leave out an important project or other component of their experience because it wasn't finished / "oficial" / etc. 
If you've done it, and it's impressive enough to "make the cut" (you shouldn't just list *everything* you've ever done), then it belongs on your resume!

### Resume Checklist

1.- Is the formatting clean, i.e. no weird multi column layouts?

2.- Best resume template: https://quip.com/MFS9AXtq5fk8

3.- Is the resume only 1 page, unless you have 10+ years experience or similar?

4.- Is the resume free of embellishment (or even worse, lies)?

5.- Is it scannable -- can I figure out school/major/roles/companies in 5-10 seconds? Consider bolding or italicizing.

6.- Is it scannable pt 2 -- have you used bullet points wherever possible?

7.- Are you avoiding having multiple different font styles?

8.- Is the alignment/organization/design consistent?

9.- Have you checked over for spelling/grammar?

10.- Current student/recent grads -- do you include major (even if non-CS student), and GPA assuming it is >= 3.1?

11.- For any questions of the form: 'should I include X,' have you asked 'if someone else had X, would it make you want to work with them more so?'

12.- Is the resume in PDF? Have you renamed it to first-last-resume.pdf, or similar? (underscores are fine, but it should include your full name and the word resume)

13.- Do you list your city and state? (And if far from where you are applying, do you note something like 'Open to working in Bay Area')

14.- Have you tailored version of your resumes for companies that are looking for very different things? (e.g. different cities, roles)

15.- Have you removed any info on religion, marital status, and ethnicity?

16.- Can someone identify your graduation year (and starting year of college, too) within 2 seconds?

17.- If you haven't started or been accepted into a MS program yet, are you leaving it off your resume?

18.- Don't include things that aren't relevant

19.- If you went to a non-well known college and are applying to a startup, do you include context on the school (e.g. 4 year university vs 2 year, etc)?

20.- If you transferred or switched schools, do you include a sentence of context as to why?

21.- Have you removed the 'objective' section, if you have one?

22.- Do you include email and phone number?

23.- Do you include Github profile, personal site, and LinkedIn URLs if relevant? And are all the URLs clickable in the PDF?

24.- Have you removed the fluff? e.g. "worked closely with product managers"

25.- Are you avoiding the spammy-looking long list of all the technologies you've worked with? (It's OK to list the ones you are proficient with).

26.- Asking again because it's so common -- do you only list languages/tools that you would be comfortable diving into in an interview?

27.- Projects/experience: do you separate experience notes by projects (most companies divide work into projects)?

28.- Projects/experience: if someone without context on your projects skimmed the bullets, would they a) get it and b) think it is cool/interesting?

29.- Projects/experience: are keywords/acronyms *only* presented in context inside project narratives? Not in lists?

30.- Projects/experience: If possible, can you work in benefits/outcomes into the narrative? (e.g. how you improved performance of Y by 15X, or how you spent 2 months on something that represents 20% of all revenue)?

31.- If possible, find a way to turn it into some kind of number. Numbers generally seem good while scanning.

32.- Seriously, don't underestimate the previous checkbox. Double check it again and try and apply this. The biggest improvements in resumes are always from the previous checkbox. Have you done it even more, for both project and employment bullet points?

33.- For projects: if they were personal projects, do you note as such? Also, if you had partners on the projects, do you note so and note what you specifically did?

34.- Optional tip to make Github better: have you added a really nice looking readme.md for the first project that shows up in your Github account? (See: https://gist.github.com/jxson/1784669)

35.- This is generally as far as someone will go on a quick scan. Click project URL, click Github project URL, scroll through readme.md in 5 seconds, close.

36.- Projects/experience: Within each experience, do you list major accomplishments before minor ones (or even better, delete minor accomplishments)?

37.- Have you applied the advice on benefits to projects, too? (e.g. write number of downloads, users, what people use the project for/why you built it, etc?)

38.- Is your resume ordered such that the best (often, but not always, newest) stuff is first? Education after experience unless it's better (e.g. 4.0 GPA top school vs o-k work experience, then education first)?

39.- If you're a semi recent grad or current student, it's generally still best to put education at the top.

40.- Only if relevant and you need more content: If you are listing courses, are you listing both names and titles, and perhaps some narrative about what you did? One-two vivid descriptions >> a list of 10 courses names.

41.- Do you realize that the resume is just a ticket to an interview?
